Together, we’ll embark on a journey of discovery and innovation as we explore how programming can be used to solve complex biological questions.\nBeyond the world of bioinformatics, I find solace and inspiration in the great outdoors. Running has become a passion of mine, and I’m currently preparing for an upcoming marathon. I’ll take you along on my training journey, sharing tips, strategies, and the triumphs and challenges I encounter along the way. Let’s explore the joys of pounding the pavement, pushing our limits, and embracing the physical and mental benefits of running."
